# Objective: create a script that the vehicle executes once powered on. In remote control mode,
# the script reads in commands from remote controller and sends corresponding commands to the
# motors. This script also coordinates all the functions that govern each sensor, communication
# module, etc. In autonomy mode, this script triggers the autonomy sub function, which takes inputs
# from relevant sensors, makes logic decisions based on sensor data, and sends commands to the
# motor. The script determines when to start and terminate the autonomy function. The script links
# all of the sub-functions from our software architecture and behaves as an entrance to the system
# logic.

# CURRENT QUESTIONS:
# 1. Do ALL of the executable .py files derive from this? Or do some run in parallel?
# 2. Doesn't QGroundControl take care of sending corresponding commands from controller to motors?
# 3. Is it better to have two distinct while loops for modes rc and auto, or better to have it nested? or other?
# 4. What would it look like to have sensor input in the autonomy mode section of the code?

# modes: remote_control (rc) and autonomous (auto)

# sensors: camera_F (front), camera_B (bottom), depth, temp_cpv (custom pressure vessel),
		 # temp_pv (cylindrical pv), leak_cpv, leak_pv, kill_switch, sonar

# actuators: arm, thruster(0 thru 7) (map to locations (ie. front-left) to avoid confusion)
